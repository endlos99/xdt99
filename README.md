xdt99: TI 99 Cross-Development Tools
====================================

The **TI 99 Cross-Development Tools** (xdt99) are a small suite of programs that
facilitate the development of programs for the TI 99 family of home computers on
modern computer systems:

 * `xas99`: A TMS9900 cross-assembler
 * `xga99`: A GPL cross-assembler
 * `xdm99`: A command-line disk manager for sector-based TI disk images
 * `xvm99`: A command-line volume manager for nanoPEB/CF7A Compact Flash cards

The `xas99` cross-assembler supports all documented TMS9900 opcodes and should
assemble any existing assembly code for the TI 99 without modification.  The
object code generated by `xas99` is identical to uncompressed object code
produced by the original TI Editor/Assembler package.

The `xga99` GPL cross-assembler generates GROM image files for TI's proprietary
Graphics Programming Language (GPL).  The GPL assembler is a quick way to
translate self-written GPL programs into RPK cartridge files that can be run
with the MESS emulator.

The `xdm99` disk manager works with sector-based TI disk images used by most
emulators, including MESS.  `xdm99` also supports the TIFiles file format.  The
`xvm99` volume manager extends the `xdm99` functionality to CF cards used by the
nanoPEB/CF7A devices.

For additional information, please refer to the [xdt99 homepage][1].

**Latest version: 1.2.x**

The latest binary distribution of xdt99 is available on the project
[releases page][2] on GitHub.  xdt99 requires [Python 2.7.x][4] and runs on any
platform that Python supports, including Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.

xdt99 is released under the GNU GPLv2.  All sources are available on
[GitHub][3].


Download and Installation
-------------------------

Download the latest [binary release][2] from GitHub.  Alternatively, clone the
entire xdt99 GitHub [repository][3].

All tools -- `xas99` cross-assembler, `xga99` GPL cross-assembler, `xdm99`
disk manager, and `xvm99` volume manager -- are standalone self-contained
Python programs (but `xvm99` requires `xdm99`).  Simply place the files
`xas99.py`, `xdm99.py`, and `xvm99.py` somewhere into your `$PATH` or whereever
your Python installation will find them.


Basic Usage: `xas99`
--------------------

This is just a brief overview of the most common usages for `xas99`.  For
detailed information, please refer to the [xdt99 homepage][1] or the manual
included with xdt99.

	$ xas99.py -i [-R] <source file>

Generate cartridge file for the MESS emulator:

	$ xas99.py -c [-R] <source file>

	$ xas99.py [-R] <source file> -L <list file>

For a complete overview of the available command-line options, see `xas99.py
-h`.


Basic Usage: `xga99`
--------------------

This is just a brief overview of the most common usages for `xga99`.  For
detailed information, please refer to the [xdt99 homepage][1] or the manual
included with xdt99.

Assemble GPL source file into GPL byte code:

	$ xga99.py <source file>

Generate image file for GROM/GRAM device:

	$ xga99.py -i <source file>

Generate cartridge file for the MESS emulator:

	$ xga99.py -c <source file>

Assemble source file using "RAG GPL Assembler" syntax style:

	$ xga99.py <source file> -s rag

For a complete overview of the available command-line options, see `xga99.py
-h`.


Basic Usage: `xdm99`
--------------------

This is just a brief overview of the most common usages for `xdm99`.  For
detailed information, please refer to the [xdt99 homepage][1] or the manual
included with xdt99.

Print disk catalog on screen:

	$ xdm99.py <disk image>

Extract one or more files from disk image to local file system:

	$ xdm99.py <disk image> -e <file> ...

Extract files in TIFiles or v9t9 format:

	$ xdm99.py <disk image> -t -e <file> ...
	$ xdm99.py <disk image> -9 -e <file> ...

Print file contents to screen:

	$ xdm99.py <disk image> -p <file> ...

Add local files to disk image:

	$ xdm99.py <disk image> -a <file> ... [-f <format>] [-n <name>]

Rename file on disk image:

	$ xdm99.py <disk image> -r <old name>:<new name> ...

Delete file on disk image:

	$ xdm99.py <disk image> -d <file> ...

Convert TIFiles files or v9t9 files to plain files:

	$ xdm99.py -F <TIFiles file> ...
	$ xdm99.py -F <TIFiles file> ... -9

Convert plain files to TIFiles files or v9t9 files:

	$ xdm99.py -T <plain file> ... [-f <format>] [-n <name>]
	$ xdm99.py -T <plain file> ... -9 [-f <format>] [-n <name>]

Print contents of TIFiles file:

	$ xdm99.py -P <TIFiles file>

Initialize blank disk:

	$ xdm99.py <filename> --initialize <size> [-n <name>]

Resize disk image:

	$ xdm99.py <disk image> -Z <sectors>

Repair disk image with corrupt files or other inconsistencies:

	$ xdm99.py -R <disk image>

Print sector dump:

	$ xdm99.py <disk image> -S <sector>

For a complete overview of the available command-line options, see `xdm99.py
-h`.


Basic Usage: `xvm99`
--------------------

This is just a brief overview of the most common usages for `xvm99`.  For
detailed information, please refer to the [xdt99 homepage][1] or the manual
included with xdt99.

Show information about volumes:

	$ xvm99.py <device> <volumes>

Read disk images from volumes:

	$ xvm99.py <device> <volumes> -r <filename> [--keep-size]

Write disk image to volumes:

	$ xvm99.py <device> <volumes> -w <disk image> [--keep-size]

`<device>` is the platform-specific name of the Compact Flash card drive, e.g.,
`/dev/sd<X>` on Linux, `/dev/Disk<X>` on Mac OS X, or `\\.\PHYSICALDRIVE<X>` on
Windows.

`<volumes>` is a single value or a combination of values and ranges, e.g.,
`1,3-4,6-10`.  If more than one volume is supplied, the same command is applied
to *all* volumes.

Additionally, `xvm99` extends most of the functionality of `xdm99` to disk
volumes.

Print disk catalog of one or more volumes:

	$ xvm99.py <device> <volumes> -i

Add file to one or more volumes:

	$ xvm99.py <device> <volumes> -a <file> [-n <name>] [-f <format>]

For a complete overview of the available command-line options, see `xvm99.py
-h`.
